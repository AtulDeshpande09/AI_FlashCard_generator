The Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, marked a significant turning point in Indian history. It began on May 10, 1857, when Indian soldiers (sepoys) in the British East India Companyâ€™s army revolted against their British officers in Meerut. The rebellion was fueled by widespread discontent with British rule, including grievances over cultural insensitivity and economic exploitation. The uprising quickly spread to various parts of India, with notable events such as the siege of Delhi and the declaration of Bahadur Shah II as the symbolic leader of the rebellion. Despite initial successes, the revolt was ultimately suppressed by the British by mid-1858. The aftermath of the rebellion led to significant changes in British policy, culminating in the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown on November 1, 1858, marking the beginning of direct British rule in India, known as the British Raj. This period lasted until India gained independence in 1947 and had lasting impacts on India's socio-political landscape.
